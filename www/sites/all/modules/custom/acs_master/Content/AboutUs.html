<h2>About Our Organization</h2>

    <p>AANE works with individuals, families, and professionals to help people with Asperger profiles or similar autism spectrum profiles build meaningful, connected lives. We do this by providing information, education, community, support, and advocacy--all in an atmosphere of validation and respect.</p>

<h3>A One-of-a-Kind Organization</h3>

    <p>AANE (Asperger/Autism Network), one of the first Asperger-focused organizations in the United States, was founded in 1996 by a small group of concerned parents and professionals, shortly after the diagnosis of Asperger Syndrome (AS) first appeared in the U.S. Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, edition IV (DSM-IV). AANE builds a supportive community by providing education, information and referrals to individuals with AS, their extended families, and the professionals who work with them.</p>

    <p>Originally called the Asperger's Association of New England, on October 1, 2014, AANE changed its name to the Asperger/Autism Network (AANE), keeping the same acronym while evolving to meet changes in the diagnostic environment and to acknowledge our expansive reach beyond New England. Our new name ensures that people who need AANE's services and support will be able to find us - regardless of where they live or what diagnosis they receive under the new DSM-5 guidelines.</p>
